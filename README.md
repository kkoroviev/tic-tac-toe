Tic-tac-toe
===========

**Tic-tac-toe** is a simple game for two players,
**X** and **O**, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks
in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This is a very primitive console version of that game.
You play against computer and are not supposed to win
(if I've coded everything OK).

To start:

    $ ./tic-tac-toe

Example output:

```
Choose your side ('X' or 'O'): X

+---+
|   |
|   |
|   |
+---+

Your turn, CROSS.
Where should I place your 'X'?

Type your choice ('x, y'; 1 <= (x, y) <= 3), or 'q<Enter>' to exit.
X: 2, 2

+---+
|   |
| X |
|   |
+---+

Your turn, NOUGHT.
Where should I place your 'O'?
O: 2, 0

+---+
|  O|
| X |
|   |
+---+

Your turn, CROSS.
Where should I place your 'X'?

Type your choice ('x, y'; 1 <= (x, y) <= 3), or 'q<Enter>' to exit.
X: 
```
